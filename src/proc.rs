//! Starting a service process, and much later killing it, with nothing running in between.
//!
//! A port of `packages/daemon/src/env/services/runners/host.ts`, minus the daemon. The daemon
//! could hold a `Child` handle and a pair of pipes for the life of the service; `canopyd up`
//! exits seconds after it starts one. Everything that makes supervision work therefore has to
//! survive in a JSON file and a pid, and the two hard parts follow from that:
//!
//! - **Nothing may be pumping the child's output.** stdout and stderr go to an append-mode file
//!   descriptor, never a pipe. See [`spawn`] for why a pipe would deadlock the service.
//! - **A pid on disk is not proof of anything.** Pids are recycled. `kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)`
//!   against a recycled pid kills a stranger's whole process group — plausibly the editor the
//!   user is typing in. Every signalling path goes through [`identify`] first, which compares
//!   the process's start time with the one recorded at spawn and refuses when it cannot tell.
//!
//! The child gets its own process group, because `npm run dev` is a shell that forks a handful
//! of children and killing only the shell leaves them holding the port.
