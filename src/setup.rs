//! Running a worktree's `setup:` steps — the port of `runShell` and `anyChanged` in
//! `packages/daemon/src/env/provision/steps.ts`.
//!
//! Setup is the slowest thing `canopyd` does and the thing most likely to fail, so three
//! decisions shape the whole module:
//!
//! - **Output is streamed, not collected.** A four-minute `npm ci` that prints nothing until it
//!   is over is indistinguishable from a hung one. Every line goes to the caller's `on_line` the
//!   moment it is read; only the last [`TAIL_LINES`] are retained, and only so a failure can
//!   quote something.
//! - **Each step gets its own process group.** `sh -c 'vite build & tsc'` leaves the backgrounded
//!   half running when only the shell is signalled. A timeout that has to be finished off by
//!   hand is not a timeout, so the group — not the shell — is what gets signalled.
//! - **`if_changed` compares bytes, never mtimes.** `git worktree add` writes every file at
//!   checkout time, so in a fresh worktree *every* mtime is newer than the source's. An mtime
//!   comparison would report "changed" for a file that is byte-for-byte identical, and the
//!   `npm ci` this feature exists to skip would run every single time.
