//! What is wrong with this repository's canopyd state, and what can safely be swept.
//!
//! Two entry points that have to agree with each other. [`diagnose`] looks and reports; it
//! changes nothing, so it is safe to run from a prompt, a status bar or a cron job. [`gc`]
//! sweeps the subset of those findings that can be *proved* dead, and nothing else.
//!
//! The proof obligation is the whole module. Everything here is state that outlives a process:
//! a port row written by a `canopyd up` that never came back, a `sleep 3600` still serving a
//! branch someone removed last week. Deleting the wrong one of those does not lose a cache, it
//! loses the only handle on a running process — so a record whose pid is alive is never touched,
//! a state directory git still lists is never removed, and a log is truncated rather than
//! deleted, because a caller may be tailing it right now.
//!
//! Severity says who has to act. [`Severity::Warning`] is debris — `gc` clears it, and it costs
//! nothing to leave. [`Severity::Error`] is something only a person can settle: a corrupt
//! registry, a port a stranger holds, a worktree git lists that is not on disk.
