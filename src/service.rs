//! Bringing a worktree's services up and down, with nothing running in between.
//!
//! `canopyd up` spawns a dev server and exits; the dev server keeps serving. There is no
//! daemon, no supervisor thread and no handle held anywhere, so every question asked later —
//! *is it running? on what pid? is it serving?* — has to be answered from two files and the
//! kernel:
//!
//! ```text
//! <state>/services/<name>.json   the ProcessRecord from proc::spawn
//! <state>/logs/<name>.log        stdout+stderr, appended
//! ```
//!
//! Three rules follow from that, and they are the whole module:
//!
//! - **The record is a claim, never an answer.** A pid on disk is a number somebody else may be
//!   wearing by now. Every path that reports or signals goes through [`crate::proc::state`],
//!   which re-reads the process's start time and compares it with the one recorded at spawn.
//!   That is also why a second `up` is harmless: the file, not our own memory, decides whether a
//!   service is already running.
//! - **A spawn is not a start.** `fork` succeeding says nothing about a command with a typo in
//!   it. [`ALIVE_GRACE`] is the fraction of a second `up` spends watching the process breathe
//!   before it dares call it running — reporting `running` for something that has already exited
//!   sends the user off to debug the wrong half of their stack.
//! - **Only `runtime: host` works here.** `docker` and `compose` are reported
//!   [`RunState::Unsupported`], loudly. Silently skipping them would leave a user staring at a
//!   green `up` and a database that was never started.
