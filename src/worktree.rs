//! Creating and removing worktrees.
//!
//! Thin on purpose: `git worktree add` and `git worktree remove` do the work, and we shell out
//! so the repository's own hooks, filters and config apply exactly as they would if the user
//! had typed the command. What this module adds is the path template, a dirty check worth
//! reading, and a branch-deletion policy.
