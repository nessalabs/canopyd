//! `canopyd run` — the foreground supervisor.
//!
//! [`crate::service::up`] starts services and returns; this blocks, keeps them alive, and stops
//! them cleanly when the caller says so. Restart policy and continuous polling live here and
//! nowhere else, on purpose: an agent or a Makefile wants fire-and-forget, a human at a terminal
//! or a CI job wants a process to babysit, and conflating the two is exactly what forces a
//! daemon into existence. `up` has no restart policy because nothing would be left running to
//! honour it.
//!
//! Six decisions carry the module:
//!
//! - **A failing health check is reported, never acted on.** Restarting an unhealthy service
//!   sounds obviously right and is the single most dangerous thing a supervisor can do: a check
//!   with a subtle mistake in it — a `localhost` that resolves to `::1` first on macOS while the
//!   service listens on IPv4 — never passes, so the supervisor kills a perfectly healthy service
//!   every few seconds forever and the user cannot tell why. Health answers "is it serving?",
//!   liveness answers "is it there?", and only the second one is allowed to kill anything.
//! - **The crash-loop budget.** Restart-with-backoff alone still means a command with a typo in
//!   it restarts every 30 seconds for the rest of the day, burning a core and a gigabyte of log.
//!   After [`Budget::restarts`] restarts inside [`Budget::window`] the service is `failed` and is
//!   left alone: a command that has failed five times in a minute is not going to succeed on the
//!   sixth, and the user needs to read the log, not watch it grow.
//! - **`run` reaps its children; `up` must not.** `run` is the parent of every service it starts,
//!   so a service that exits becomes a zombie until somebody calls `waitpid`. That call is also
//!   the *only* place an exit status can be read, which is what makes `restart: on-failure`
//!   possible at all — see [`observe_exit`]. `up` exits seconds after spawning, which reparents
//!   its children to init; init reaps them, and an `up` that waited would only be waiting for a
//!   service it is about to walk away from.
//! - **A dependent waits for its dependency to be serving, and not forever.** `depends_on` with
//!   a health check means "start me once that one answers", which is the only reading that
//!   makes a web server that reads a token its API writes at boot work at all. But a check that
//!   never passes must not mean a dependent that never starts: once the dependency has had its
//!   whole health window and a little more, the dependent starts anyway, and the failing check
//!   is reported on the dependency where it belongs.
//! - **Requests come in through the loop, not around it.** An embedder that wants one service
//!   stopped cannot call `down` from another process: the exit would look like a crash, and
//!   `restart: always` would undo it a second later. It hands a [`Control`] to the loop instead,
//!   which stops the service itself and then *holds* it — out of reach of the restart policy
//!   until somebody asks for it back. The services stay this process's children either way, so
//!   an exit status is still readable after a requested restart.
//! - **No signal handler in here.** `run` takes a `should_stop` flag and a [`Clock`]. A library
//!   that installed a `SIGINT` handler would steal it from every embedder, and tests of a
//!   supervisor that owned real signals and real time would be slow and flaky. The binary owns
//!   the handler; this owns what to do when it fires.
