//! Port allocation — the one place a port number comes from.
//!
//! Every consumer (the env file, a health check, a `${ports.web}` in a `run:` line) asks this
//! module and nobody re-derives a number, because two answers to "which port is web?" is the
//! same bug as no answer at all.
//!
//! Three properties, in the order they matter:
//!
//! - **An existing allocation always wins.** A URL a developer bookmarked has to survive a
//!   restart, so a row in the registry is handed back untouched and is never re-probed — the
//!   service bound to it right now is usually the reason it is in use.
//! - **A new name starts from a hash of `project/branch/name`**, so the same branch tends to
//!   get the same numbers on every machine, and walks forward from there past anything already
//!   allocated or already bound.
//! - **The registry is the authority across branches.** The port column is unique registry-wide,
//!   which is what stops two worktrees of the same repo landing on one number.
//!
//! Ported from `packages/daemon/src/env/ports/allocator.ts`, with two deliberate differences:
//! the hash runs over UTF-8 bytes rather than UTF-16 code units (Rust has no UTF-16 to hash),
//! and the bind probe tests both IP stacks rather than IPv4 alone.
